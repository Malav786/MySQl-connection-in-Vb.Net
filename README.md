In this project, i've tried to connect MySql with my WindowsForm that i've made using Vb.Net on Visual Studio 2022 to store data which is enterd by user. Here you can also use some features like Delete, Reset, Update, Print, Search, Add New..etc. 
On the first page if you click on go to registration then it will take you to the Registration Form.
There you have to add your Credentials i.e. your Username and Password.
If you don't have account then you should click on 'Register' button to create your new account(It should have Unique Username and Password) and then try to login again with your neew credentials and then it will take you to the new loading page and further process will keep going on
Thank you for seeing into my project..!
Next moto to add 'Forgot Password'
